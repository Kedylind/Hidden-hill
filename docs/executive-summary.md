Executive Summary: What you're building and why (2-3 paragraphs)
The project aims to build an AI-powered platform that transforms scientific and medical research into concise, visually engaging, and easily understandable short-form videos. The problem it addresses is the growing gap between scientific discovery and public understanding, in an age of misinformation, even accurate research often fails to reach or resonate with non-expert audiences. By using automation and intelligent summarization, the platform helps bridge this gap, ensuring that credible information can be communicated effectively and at scale.
This solution targets both the supply side (researchers, institutions, journals struggling with science communication) and the demand side (general audiences and healthcare professionals seeking credible, digestible summaries). The long-term vision is to make evidence-based knowledge as accessible and shareable as viral content, combining the rigor of academia with the reach of social media.
User Research: Personas, user journeys, problem validation
Personas
1.	Academic Researcher (Producer Persona): Needs to communicate their findings in an engaging way but lacks design or video production skills. Values credibility, accuracy, and time efficiency
2.	Educator (Bridge Persona): Works to translate science into accessible messages for public campaigns. Seeks tools that maintain scientific integrity while simplifying messaging
3.	General Audience Member/Student (Consumer Persona): Has limited scientific literacy but high social media engagement. Values clarity, trustworthiness, and brevity
User Journeys
-	Academic Researcher Journey (Producer Persona)
Goal: Communicate recent findings from a published paper in an engaging, accessible video format
Journey:
1.	Log in & Upload: Researcher logs into the platform and uploads a recent PDF
2.	Automatic Extraction: The system extracts title, abstract, key figures, and main findings using NLP (Natural Language Processing)
3.	AI Summary Generation: The AI generates a concise, 1-minute video script summarizing the study
4.	Review & Edit: The researcher reviews the script, adjusts phrasing for accuracy, and adds a few keywords for tone (“professional,” “educational”)
5.	Storyboard Preview: The platform creates a visual storyboard (scene breakdown + captions)
6.	Render Video: The researcher clicks “Render,” generating a short educational clip suitable for conferences or social media
Outcome: The researcher saves hours of manual work while maintaining credibility.
-	Educator Journey (Bridge Persona)
Goal: Use recent scientific findings to create public education content for a health campaign
Journey:
1.	Log in: Educator logs into the platform
2.	Search for Topics: The educator searches “climate and health impacts” in the content library
3.	Browse Summaries: The platform displays pre-reviewed summaries generated by verified researchers
4.	Select & Adapt: The educator selects a summary video and adapts the narration style for a high school audience (choosing “simplified tone” in settings)
5.	Add Visuals: The educator uploads their organization’s logo and adds a short call-to-action at the end
6.	Export Video: The finalized video is exported in a 1:1 format for Instagram and a 16:9 format for YouTube
Outcome: The educator quickly produces scientifically accurate and visually appealing content for outreach campaigns.
-	General Audience/Student Journey (Consumer Persona)
Goal: Learn about emerging scientific topics in a credible yet engaging format
Journey:
1.	Log in: Student logs into the platform
2.	Discover Content: The user scrolls through a “Science Shorts” feed on the platform’s homepage or mobile app
3.	Watch Summaries: They tap on a 60-second video summarizing a new cancer therapy study
4.	Learn More: The viewer clicks “Read the Original Paper” to access the journal link or summary notes
Outcome: Non-experts gain exposure to credible science through short, engaging summaries
Problem Validation
-	Surveys and interviews with researchers and educators revealed frustration with the time and cost required to create educational media.
-	Audiences often report confusion about conflicting or misleading health information online.
Product Vision: MVP scope, key features, success metrics
MVP Scope
-	Core feature: Automated summarization and script generation from research papers.
-	Simple user interface for uploading content and generating draft video scripts.
-	Creating a que system for the video to show its lineup and loading production.
Key Features
-	AI-driven text summarization tailored for medical/scientific literature.
-	Style adaptation for different audiences (e.g., clinicians vs. public).
-	Review interface for user edits and fact-checking.
-	Integration for citation and source tracking.

Technical Architecture: Framework, database, deployment decisions
1.	Backend Framework: Django with Django REST Framework for user authentication, file uploads, and serving APIs between the frontend and AI translation pipeline
2.	Database: PostgreSQL on Railway to store user data, uploaded paper metadata, and video generation progress
3.	Deployment Platform: Railway for hosting both the web app and background worker with automatic GitHub integration and low maintenance cost
4.	Third-Party Services: Cloudflare R2 for affordable storage of PDFs and videos, OpenAI API for summarization and script creation, and Google Cloud Video Intelligence & Text-to-Speech APIs for generating and assembling the AI videos
5.	Development Workflow: GitHub for version control, GitHub Projects for backlog tracking, and GitHub Actions for simple CI and code review before merge

Sprint 2 Plan: Sprint goal, committed stories, team capacity
Sprint Goal: To implement and test the end-to-end summarization workflow allowing users to upload a research article, generate an AI-based summary, and review/edit the generated script through the web interface. This sprint aims to move from isolated components (upload + summarization) toward a cohesive, working MVP that demonstrates the project’s core value: transforming complex research into accessible, digestible summaries.
Sprint Focus:
-	Integrate backend and frontend through working APIs
-	Test summarization performance and accuracy
-	Establish logging and monitoring for Celery tasks
-	Conduct first user demo of the upload → summarize → edit flow
